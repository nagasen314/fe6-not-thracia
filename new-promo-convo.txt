[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere,
I must speak with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...The attack on Bern will begin
after we finish in Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did someone tell
you already?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No... I simply knew that it would
come to this eventually.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...We cannot leave Bern
unopposed any longer.[A]
I know it will be painful to see
your homeland invaded, but...[A]



[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]...Roy, I want you
to have this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]What is it?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Bern's greatest treasure...
the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]What?![A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]In southern Bern lies a temple
called the Shrine of Seals.[A]
Within it lies the sword of Hartmut,
founder of Bern.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is it...
a legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Yes. The most powerful of
them all, in fact.[A]
It was made to slay the leader of
the dragons in the Scouring.[A]
It's power was so immense that it had
to be sealed away after the war.[A]
The Fire Emblem is the key to
accessing it once more.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The key...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast] It will also confer some
measure of Hartmut's power,[A]
though one would still need
the blade to harness its true[A]
might. I humbly ask you to
help me retake my home,[A]
in exchange for Hartmut's
blessing.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]I am honored, Lady Guinivere.
I accept.[A]






[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My brother...is forcing the world
into submission with military might.[A]
I cannot forgive him, no matter
his reasons.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]All we must do to stop him is
defeat the dragons he commands.[A]
[OpenRight]Princess Guinivere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]...I will be remembered in infamy,
as a traitor to my nation.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]No...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The people will resent me
for the rest of my days.[A]
Roy, promise me this
one thing.[A]
When we invade Bern, do
not harm any civilians...[A]
[OpenRight]I will not.
I promise you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Thank you.[A]
